Privacy Policy for CojoVi
Welcome to the Wild Side of Privacy

This Privacy Policy is here to tell you how CojoVi ("we," "us," or "our") handles your personal information when you visit our website, located at www.cojovi.com (the "Website"). Spoiler alert: we don't sell your data to aliens, but we might share it with some robots.

What We Collect (and Nope, Not Unicorn Dust)

We gather some information from you, and here's the lowdown:

Personal Information: This includes your name, email address, phone number, and billing address when you:

Place an order for our hilarious services
Contact us through a form, live chat, or telepathic link (okay, maybe not that last one)
Subscribe to our laugh-out-loud newsletter
Usage Data: We collect info about your antics on the Website, like the pages you visit, the jokes you laugh at, and the links you click. This might involve cookies (the digital kind, not the chocolate chip variety).

How We Use Your Info (No, We Won't Prank Call You)

We use the info we collect to:

Provide and improve our services
Process your orders and requests
Send you promotional emails (only if you consent – no spammy nonsense)
Respond to your hilarious inquiries
Analyze how you use the Website and laugh at our jokes
Personalize your comedic experience on the Website
Sharing Your Info (No, We Don't Kiss and Tell)

We might share your info with third-party service providers who help us run the Website and deliver our comedy gold. These providers are obligated to keep your info safe and use it only to perform the services we request.

We may also disclose your info if required by law or to protect the rights and safety of ourselves or others. But don't worry, we won't share it with your nosy neighbor.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies (Not the Tasty Kind)

We use cookies and other tracking technologies to monitor your activity on the Website. Cookies are small data files placed on your device when you visit a website. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. If you refuse cookies, some parts of the Website might not function properly (sorry, no cookie crumbs in our code).

Your Choices (You’re the Boss)

You have choices about your info:

You can opt out of marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in those emails.
You can adjust your browser settings to control cookies.
Data Security (Guarded by Digital Ninjas)

We take reasonable steps to protect your info from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. So, while we’re good, we’re not invincible superheroes.

Children's Privacy (Sorry, Kids – Adults Only)

Our Website is not intended for children under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personal info from kids under 13. If you're a parent and believe your child has provided us with personal info, please contact us. We'll handle it faster than a dad joke at a family reunion.

Changes to This Privacy Policy (Plot Twist!)

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We’ll notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Website. Keep your eyes peeled for updates (and jokes).

Contact Us (Don’t Be a Stranger)

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at [insert email address]. We promise to respond faster than you can say "Why did the chicken cross the road?"
