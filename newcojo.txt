Community-Building Tips
1. Observations and Critique of Current Content
From a review of your current website (as it was originally designed to showcase your skillset while you were job hunting), here are the overarching points:

Resume-Like Language: The site likely reads in a way that positions you as a professional for hire. The tone is promotional and service-oriented:

Outlines your skills, services, or areas of expertise.
Possibly uses phrases like “Hire me,” “My Services,” or “What I can do for you.”
Professional Branding: The design and layout might be more personal branding–focused rather than community-based:

Heavy focus on you, your background, and your experience.
Formal or corporate tone, with little to no user input or group discussion elements.
Calls to Action: The existing calls to action probably revolve around contacting you for work or learning more about your skills.

Limited Community Interaction: There may be a minimal mention of collaborative or community-building features:

No explicit invitation to join a forum, chat, or community space.
The emphasis is on your personal capabilities rather than knowledge-sharing or group input.
2. Recommended Content Strategy
Shift in Purpose
The overarching change is to move away from “I’m offering these services” to “I’m building a collective where we can learn, share, and troubleshoot together.”

Community-Focused Messaging

Use more inclusive and invitational language: "Join the conversation," "Let’s build solutions together," “We want to see what you're working on,” etc.
Present Yourself as a Facilitator/Enthusiast

You remain the expert and professional, but the tone emphasizes your role as a community builder and collaborator rather than a hired consultant.
Value Proposition for Members

Express how members will benefit by joining your Discord, reading your blog, or engaging in your community: learning new coding tips, feedback on projects, and collaborative problem-solving.
Encourage User-Generated Content

Show how others can participate by:
Submitting code snippets
Sharing 3D printing projects
Collaborating on AI and coding challenges
Highlight Interactive Channels

Promote Discord as your central gathering spot.
Possibly embed a Discord widget or direct call-to-action to get potential community members to join easily.

5. Implementation Roadmap
Update Navigation & Site Structure

Rename or reorganize “Services” pages into community pages (e.g., “Community” or “Join Discord” or “Projects & Blog”).
Ensure easy click-through navigation that funnels newcomers straight to your Discord.
Refresh Written Content

Replace all first-person marketing (“I can do this for you”) with inclusive community language (“We do this together,” “Join us,” “Let’s build”).
Incorporate Community Visuals

Showcase community snapshots, if you have them (Discord group screenshots, collaborative projects, user-submitted images).
Add any relevant community badges, for instance if you use GitHub for hosting open-source code or if your Discord server has certain unique features.
Implement a Discord Invitation Link

Prominently display a Discord invitation link or embedded widget. Possibly embed a real-time message feed or user count to encourage site visitors to join.
Launch a Blog/Forum Section (If you haven’t already)

Make it easy for both you and community members to publish tutorials, highlight interesting solutions, and share code examples.
Keep moderation in mind, set simple guidelines for how community members can submit content.
Optimize SEO & Social Sharing

Use key phrases around “AI community,” “coding tutorials,” “software development collaboration,” etc.
Encourage members to share the site on social media and cross-pollinate with other communities.
Encourage Member Interaction

Plan monthly or weekly coding challenges, AI hackathons, or Q&A sessions to keep the channel lively.
Add a “Meet the Member” feature where community members can do short interviews or project showcases.
6. Community-Building Tips
Consistency is Key

Regularly post updates, share quick tips, or run micro-events to keep engagement high.
Open and Welcoming Tone

Encourage new members to introduce themselves. Consider a pinned “Welcome” message or #introductions channel to reduce first-time friction.
Encourage Cross-Collaboration

If members need testers, coders, or feedback, create designated channels or threads to facilitate these requests.
Reward Engagement

Recognize helpful members with custom roles or badges on Discord.
Feature user-generated content (like “Project of the Month”) on the site’s homepage or blog.
Manage Growth and Rules

Have clear guidelines about conduct, spam prevention, and overall community standards. You want a safe, respectful environment.
Conclusion
By pivoting Cojovi.com from a professional portfolio to a collaborative tech community, you’ll harness collective expertise and passion. This approach not only builds your personal brand in a more organic way but also creates a value-rich environment for other programmers, AI enthusiasts, and makers to connect.

To achieve this:

Revamp your text with inclusive language.
Highlight the Discord community as the central hub.
Showcase user-submitted projects to inspire and engage members.
Keep fresh content flowing through short tutorials, blog posts, and interactive events.
Moderate and sustain the community with positive, consistent engagement.
With these changes, Cojovi.com becomes more than just your personal resumé—it transforms into a thriving community that supports and celebrates its members’ creativity and technical skills. This alignment with “sharing” and “community building” will also naturally reflect your passion and expertise, further solidifying your standing in the broader AI and coding world.

Good luck with the transformation—here’s to building a vibrant, collaborative online space!
