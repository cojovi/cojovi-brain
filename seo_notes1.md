Here's a no-fluff rundown to boost your site's SEO based on the Lighthouse insights:

Meta & HTML Essentials

Titles & Descriptions: Every page needs a unique, keyword-rich title (≤60 characters) and meta description (≤160 characters).
Language Attribute: Make sure your <html> tag includes lang="en" (or your target language) so search engines know what they're reading.
Viewport & Robots: Confirm the meta viewport tag is set and that your robots.txt isn’t accidentally blocking important pages.
Structured Data & Canonicals

Schema Markup: Implement JSON-LD (or Microdata) for things like articles, products, or breadcrumbs. This helps Google serve rich snippets.
Canonical URLs: Ensure each page has a proper canonical tag to prevent duplicate content penalties.
Performance & Mobile Optimization

Speed Matters: Optimize images (use compression and lazy loading), minify CSS/JS, and leverage caching. A fast site not only improves user experience but also ranks better.
Mobile-First: Even if the Lighthouse report is for desktop, Google indexes mobile first—make sure your site is fully responsive.
Content & Link Strategy

Quality Content: Produce engaging, relevant content with natural keyword integration. Avoid keyword stuffing at all costs.
Internal Linking: Use a logical internal linking structure to help search engines understand site hierarchy and distribute link equity.
Backlinks: Build quality external links; they’re still a big ranking factor.
Additional Tweaks

Security: You’re on HTTPS, but double-check for mixed content issues.
Sitemap Submission: Create and submit an XML sitemap via Google Search Console to ensure all pages get crawled.
Social Tags: Implement Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags so your content shines when shared on social media—indirect SEO perks.
In short, fix any technical snags flagged by Lighthouse, ramp up your content quality, and keep your site lightning-fast and mobile-friendly. Get these right, and you’ll see better crawling, indexing, and ultimately, more visibility on Google.
