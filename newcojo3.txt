Invite Participation: End each section with a call to join your Discord, comment, or share experiences.
Showcase Others’ Success: Rather than focusing solely on your expertise, highlight what the community can collectively achieve—this makes new visitors feel more welcome to contribute.
By shifting the copy toward a community-oriented approach, you encourage ongoing engagement, shared learning, and mutual support—rather than a purely transactional service.
